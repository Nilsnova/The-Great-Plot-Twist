# Decision log

Record choices that affect other contributors: game behavior, architecture, shared interfaces, dependencies, data storage or deployment. Routine implementation details belong in the PR.

Add short entries; keep the original rationale when superseding a decision.

## D001 · Shared collaboration workflow · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Proposed in the collaboration setup PR; accepted when reviewed by another teammate and merged.

**Decision:** Equal teammate authority; task branches; small PRs; one independent human review; explicit agent handovers. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Why:** Allow parallel human/agent work while keeping changes understandable and protecting each person’s contributions.

**Alternative:** Direct shared pushes to main. Rejected for the proposed workflow because overlapping changes would be harder to review and reconcile.

## D002 · Hosting: Vercel Hobby with two Services, Supabase Free in Ireland · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Proposed in the foundation PR; accepted when reviewed by another teammate and merged.

**Decision:** One Vercel project on the free Hobby plan runs two Vercel Services: the game in `frontend/` (a static Vite build) and the Python API in `backend/` (FastAPI, entry `main:app`). `vercel.json` sends every `/api/...` address to the backend and everything else to the frontend, so both share one address. Functions run in one region, Dublin (`dub1`). The database, the GitHub sign-in and realtime come from one Supabase Free project in West EU (Ireland, `eu-west-1`), set up with the Data API on, "Automatically expose new tables" off, "Enable automatic RLS" on, GitHub as the only sign-in and no Supabase GitHub integration. The build stays portable, a static site plus a separate Python API, because the course may still publish deployment rules. We do not email the teaching team about hosting.

**Why:** Both services have free plans. One address for the game and the API needs no cross-origin setup. Rules in Python can be tested with pytest, as in the course. The functions run next to the database. A portable build makes a later move cheap.

**Alternatives and trade-offs:** A Vite app at the root plus `api/index.py`: Vercel documents file-based Python functions for existing projects and points new apps to a FastAPI preset or to Services. Two separate Vercel projects: the fallback if Services, still a Beta, lets us down. Paris (`cdg1` with Supabase `eu-west-3`) is a little closer to Lisbon; Ireland was chosen when the project was created. Trade-offs: whether cron works together with Services is undocumented, so the daily keep-alive call waits for the first deploy; preview and production share the one Supabase project; a free Supabase project pauses after 7 days of low activity. Update, 5 Nov 2026: a `crons` entry in `vercel.json` stopped our production deploys (fixed in commit `409316e`), so `vercel.json` must never get one while we use Services; what calls the keep-alive once a day became an open decision, and later that evening Nils chose a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/keepalive.yml`) (see the keep-alive section of [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-7-day-pause-and-the-keep-alive)).

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Nils, 5 Nov 2026. Proposed in the foundation PR (`chore/foundation`). Affects everyone: `vercel.json`, `backend/main.py`, [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## D003 · Rules live on the server; the browser never writes game data · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Proposed in the foundation PR; accepted when reviewed by another teammate and merged.

**Decision:** Game rules live in Python on the server (`backend/server/`), tested with pytest. The browser shows the game and sends intents; it never decides money, progress or names. A signed-in player may only read: every profile and wallet reason, plus their own save, wallet, ledger rows and crews. Every write goes through the server with the secret key. Saves are written only by the server: the sign-up trigger creates an empty save, and the first package that saves progress adds a server route that checks the data first. Display names are written only by the server too: at sign-up every player gets a neutral placeholder (`Captain-` and 6 characters of their id), never the GitHub login. The database also guards itself, with explicit grants and row-level security on every table, constraints, and one atomic wallet function.

**Why:** Anyone can change the code that runs in their own browser, so a rule enforced there is no rule. Plain Python functions are easy to test with pytest and to explain line by line. The database refuses what is not allowed even if the Python has a bug. Names appear on a projector, and players control their own login details.

**Alternatives and trade-offs:** Letting the browser write its own save or name under row-level security: rejected, because a player could then write any progress or any name. Foundation wave 1 still took the display name from the GitHub login and let players rename themselves; wave 2 removed both. Trade-off: every action that changes something is a round trip to the server.

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Nils, 5 Nov 2026. Proposed in the foundation PR. Affects every package that changes game state: each write needs a server route ([ENGINEERING.md, recipe 4.1](ENGINEERING.md#41-add-an-api-endpoint)) and keeps the policy matrix in [supabase/README.md](../supabase/README.md#who-may-do-what) true. Generated captain names follow in package A2.

## D004 · Play-money wallet: one ledger, every balance starts at 0 · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Proposed in the foundation PR; accepted when reviewed by another teammate and merged.

**Decision:** Coins are play money only: they cannot be bought, cashed out or exchanged for real prizes. One wallet per player and one ledger (`wallet_transactions`) serve every money feature. A new wallet starts at 0 coins (`STARTING_BALANCE`) and the sign-up trigger writes no ledger row; coins arrive from the entry kit (`kit_grant`) and from rewards. Every change names a reason from the table `wallet_reasons`, and each reason has a direction: `earn` adds coins, `spend` takes them away, `either` may do both. Only the server moves coins, through one atomic database function (`apply_wallet_transaction`) that checks the reason, its direction and the balance and writes the ledger row in the same step. Every coin change needs a `ref` (Python and the database both refuse a missing or blank one), and the ledger holds each player, reason and `ref` once, so a repeated request changes nothing. The first eight reasons are `kit_grant`, `clue_reward`, `mystery_reward`, `event_reward`, `cargo_sale`, `clue_purchase`, `building_purchase` and `admin_adjust`.

**Why:** Every money-like feature shares one wallet, defined once (Nils' roadmap inputs). A ledger that only the server writes means no player can edit their own balance, and every balance can be explained row by row. One atomic function cannot spend the same coins twice. Play money with no cash-out and no prizes keeps the game clear of gambling: Supabase's acceptable use policy forbids facilitating unregulated gambling, Vercel Hobby is for non-commercial use only, and Portuguese law defines gambling around money (our reading of the sources, not legal advice).

**Alternatives and trade-offs:** Foundation wave 1 gave every new player 1000 coins with a `starting_grant` ledger row, and fixed ten reasons in a check rule on the ledger. Wave 2 replaced both: coins now come from the game, and a new reason is one new row plus one Python line ([ENGINEERING.md, recipe 4.7](ENGINEERING.md#47-add-a-wallet-reason)). Trade-offs: the sign of an amount is checked by the function and by Python, not by a table rule, because a table rule cannot look into another table; and a `503` from the wallet means the outcome is unknown.

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Nils, 5 Nov 2026. Proposed in the foundation PR. Affects every money feature: each adds its reasons by migration and says in its spec where its `ref` comes from.

## D012 · Crews and seats: up to four seats, each a player or an NPC partner · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Proposed in the foundation PR; accepted when reviewed by another teammate and merged.

**Decision:** A crew has up to four seats, numbered 1 to 4. Each taken seat holds exactly one of two: a player, or an NPC partner (a crew mate the game runs). A seat nobody holds has no row. Solo play is a crew of one player in seat 1 with NPC partners in the other seats. With friends, NPC partners fill any empty seats, and a friend can take over an NPC partner's seat. Only the server writes crews and seats, and a player reads only the crews they sit in. The server, not the database, makes sure a player has at most one active crew.

**Why:** Nils asked for a game that is also playable alone, with NPC partners in the empty seats, and for this to be in the foundation from the start. One model for solo and group play means one set of rules and tests.

**Alternatives and trade-offs:** A seat's player link set to empty (`on delete set null`) when the player is deleted: rejected, because a seat with neither a player nor an NPC partner breaks the rule "exactly one of the two", so deleting a seated player would fail. With `on delete cascade` the seat row goes with the player (tested on Postgres 17 in wave 2). Trade-offs: the database does not stop one player from holding two seats in one crew, or one NPC partner from sitting twice, so the server must; deleting the player who started a crew deletes the whole crew.

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Nils, 5 Nov 2026. Proposed in the foundation PR. The team roadmap reserves D005 to D010 for other decisions and D012 for this one. Affects A6 (crew routes and codes), S4 (NPC partners), and S3 and L3 (rules that count seats). What NPC partners do in the mystery is defined by the story package S0 (skeleton under review).

## D005 · Look: original top-down pixel art · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Decided by Nils; recorded with the graphics package G1, which is merged into `main`.

**Decision:** The game is drawn in original top-down pixel art: sprites authored by our own code (the generator in `frontend/scripts/pixel_art/`), one world unit = 16 native pixels, nearest-neighbour scaling, snapped positions, and gold kept for light, interaction and clues. Every asset and its source is listed in `frontend/ASSETS.md`.

**Why:** Nils found the first low-poly 3D diorama generic, tried an illustrated paper style, and approved the pixel-art gameplay presentation on 5 Nov 2026. Pixel art gives the game a clear identity, stays light on student laptops and lets one generator keep every new sprite in the same style.

**Alternatives and trade-offs:** Light 3D low-poly (first study) and a flat illustrated "nautical journal" paper style (second study), both kept only as superseded iteration material. Trade-off: every new place, building and character needs new sprites from the generator.

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Nils, 5 Nov 2026, in his session with Codex; merged into `main` as `45d2d46`. Affects every visual package (G2, G3, G4, L2) and the art list in the story documents.

## D013 · Story decisions for the skeleton v1 · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Decided by Nils on 5 Nov 2026 when he approved the story skeleton ([docs/STORY.md](STORY.md)).

**Decision:** (1) Each crew plays its own copy of the case; the first solve anywhere relights the coast for everyone. (2) Story v2 makes small `story.json` edits only. (3) NPC partners v1 are scripted errand runners. (4) The class demo is very short and shows highlights only. (5) The culprit is the harbor master; characters have titles, not personal names (Elena Vos stays the only named character).

**Why:** These five choices meet Nils' rules at once: a joint puzzle for four players in about two hours, playable alone, a world that changes and keeps going, and a fair twist built on lines that are already in the original game.

**Alternatives and trade-offs:** One global case solved once (later players could only read about it); a bigger rewrite of the intro; NPC partners with free hints or an AI voice; the demo as a live first solve. Trade-off: copies per crew need a clear rule for what the first solve changes for everyone (detailed in the story detail round).

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Nils, 5 Nov 2026. Affects S0 to S4, L3 and A6.

## D015 · Coordination merges by Claude under the owner's authorization · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Decided by Nils (repository owner) on 5 Nov 2026.

**Decision:** Claude may push branches and merge its own verified coordination work into `main` without a teammate's approval (merge commits; tests, build and a secret scan first), and records each such merge in [docs/STATUS.md](STATUS.md). The first one was the bootstrap merge `a0e501a`. Teammates' changes keep the peer-review rule of D001.

**Why:** Nils wanted the team to start from a working `main` the same day, before the teammates had joined, and authorized Claude to push and merge without asking, keeping questions for important decisions.

**Alternatives and trade-offs:** Wait for a teammate's review of every early change (slower start). Trade-off: early `main` history was not peer-reviewed, so the team reviews it afterwards, commit by commit, at kickoff.

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Nils, 5 Nov 2026. Affects how `main` gets coordination and integration work; it never replaces review for teammates' own packages.

## D007 · Plot Twist imported as an unchanged copy · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Decided by Nils on 5 Nov 2026 (the team brings the story into this repository, so nobody needs the private solo repository). Proposed in the S1 pull request; accepted when reviewed by another teammate and merged.

**Decision:** Nils' solo game Plot Twist (*The Keeper's Last Log*, his private repository `Plot-Twist`, branch `main` at commit `e235ee4`) is brought into this repository as a copy. The story file is byte for byte the original (SHA-256 `3713d17a778d7ad3cfe8a8f24e33810bc96a54e1f8be90f3babf15d5698c66a2`). The Python engine, the JavaScript engine and the 11 original tests (9 acceptance and content tests, 2 parity tests) are ported with the same rules and the same assertions. Only what the web game needs changed: where the files live, a `save_path=None` option so the server never writes files, ES-module syntax and an injectable storage in the browser engine. The terminal game (`cli.py`) and the old web interface are not imported. The solo repository is never changed. The provenance note is in [backend/content/README.md](../backend/content/README.md#where-this-story-came-from). Where the content folder lives is a separate decision, D016.

**Why:** Nils decided that the team writes the next version of the story itself, so everything it needs must be in this repository. A copy with a provenance note keeps the original traceable, and unchanged rules mean the 11 original tests still prove that the game works.

**Alternatives and trade-offs:** Keep the game in the private solo repository and copy files when needed: Nils decided against it. Rewrite the engines: not needed, because the original rules and tests work, and decision 2 in D013 keeps the engines frozen. Trade-off: there are now two engines, one in Python and one in JavaScript, that must stay equal rule for rule. The parity test (`backend/plot_twist/tests/test_web_parity.py`) fails when they differ.

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Nils, 5 Nov 2026. Proposed in the S1 pull request (`feat/s1-import-plot-twist`). Affects S2 (the story in the browser) and A3 (the referee replays the move log with the Python engine).

## D016 · Server content lives in backend/content/; the browser gets public content through the API · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Proposed in the S1 pull request. It stays proposed until Nils accepts it and a different teammate has reviewed it, because it moves the content paths of S3, S4, A2, A3, L2, L4 and L5.

**Decision:** Game content that the server uses (the story, the case, names, buildings, companies, questions) lives in `backend/content/`, not in a `content/` folder at the repository root. The format of each file is written in [backend/content/README.md](../backend/content/README.md). Public content, which the browser needs in order to play, is served by `GET /api/content/{name}`, and only for the names on a fixed list in `backend/server/routes/content.py` (today `intro-story`). Secret content, for example the real solution of the case, lives in `backend/content/secret/` and is never served. Data that only the browser uses, such as the place registry `frontend/src/world/places/registry.js`, stays in `frontend/`.

**Why:** Vercel builds each service from its own folder only (D002): the API from `backend/` and the game from `frontend/`. The Python runtime bundles the service folder, so files inside `backend/` reach the API, while files in a root `content/` folder may not (the roadmap flagged this risk for S1). The game is built from `frontend/` only, so a secret file in `backend/` cannot end up in the game by accident. That matters for the case solution.

**Alternatives and trade-offs:** A root `content/` folder read by both services (the first proposal in the roadmap): the API may not see it on Vercel, and the game build could pick up a secret file by accident. Two copies of each file, one per service: the copies would drift apart. Trade-offs: the browser downloads public content with one API call instead of having it inside the bundle. The route sends `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`, which only browsers obey. So a changed story takes up to five minutes to reach a page that is already open, and every new visitor still starts the API function. Whether to add `s-maxage=300` for Vercel's network is open; if we do, check on a preview that the header `x-vercel-cache` says HIT. Not checked yet: that the deployed API finds `backend/content/story.json` (A3 checks it on a preview).

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Proposed by Claude for Nils, 5 Nov 2026, in the S1 pull request (`feat/s1-import-plot-twist`). Not accepted yet. If it is accepted, these content files go under `backend/content/`: `secret/case.json` for S3, `partners.json` for S4, `names.json` for A2, `entry_kits.json` for A3, `buildings.json` for L2, `companies.json` for L4 and `questions.json` for L5. The roadmap, the interfaces page, the status page and the engineering rules already use these paths. If it is not accepted, revert those paths.

## D017 · Island Exchange rules · 2026-11-05

**Status:** Decided by Nils on 5 Nov 2026 (his answers to the Exchange questions, items 1 to 7; item 2c, 10x positions, replaces the x100 price amplification of items 1 and 2a). The points marked "chosen here" are defaults Claude took for the rework and told Nils; they stand unless he objects. This version replaces v1 (see "History"), which was merged but never went live: its migration was never applied.

**Decision:**
1. **Real prices, 1:1.** Seven invented island companies follow seven real instruments at their real Binance prices (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB, EUR/USD as EURUSDT, gold as PAXG; around the clock; no key). Real stock companies, shown with their real names, follow their real share prices through a stock-price API with a free key that Nils creates (agents never sign up), chosen by the settings `STOCK_API_PROVIDER` and `STOCK_API_KEY` and off until the key exists. Chosen here, from the research memo of 5 Nov: Finnhub for five US companies, switched on only once Finnhub has agreed in writing that the prices may be shown. No floor, no ceiling, no pauses.
2. **Every investment is a 10x position,** rising or falling, with a stake of coins. Each 1 % the price moves for the position adds 10 % of the stake, each 1 % against takes 10 % away.
3. **Closed at zero.** A position whose stake is used up (price at 90 % of the entry for a rising position, 110 % for a falling one) closes automatically at zero; a jump past that point also closes it at zero. A player never loses more than the stake and the opening fee and never owes coins.
4. **Market hours.** A stock trades only while its market is open (New York, Euronext or Xetra, from a calendar file with the holidays from 6 Nov to 31 Dec 2026). While its market is closed or a price source is away, a company shows its last price with a label and cannot be traded, and its positions are neither closed nor used up until fresh prices arrive. Island companies never close.
5. **Demo mode** plays the recorded Binance Vision day, clearly labelled, and trading on it is allowed; those trades change players' real coins, and the recording is public. Chosen here: stocks are not part of it.
6. **No price protection.** A trade goes through at the server price of that moment.
7. **Brakes.** A trade uses a price at most 5 seconds old (fetched fresh if older); a player makes at most 10 trades in 30 seconds.
8. **Fee:** 2 % of the stake, rounded up, at opening and again at closing; 1 % after the Relighting. The closing fee comes out of the value and is never more than it.
9. **Limits:** at most 500 coins per position and 2,000 coins of new stakes per game day (from 08:00 Lisbon time). Chosen here: at least 10 coins per position, at most 20 open positions.
10. **Positions stay open across days.** No minimum holding time.
11. **Chosen here:** the automatic close runs whenever the server looks at prices (every board look, every trade, every portfolio look) and uses only prices it fetched; positions opened on live prices close only on live prices, recording positions only on the recording; after the Relighting Greyfathom Salvage takes no new positions; an open rising position in Greyfathom Salvage is the "Greyfathom share" of card C6.
12. **Database:** migration `20261106090000_exchange_leverage.sql` removes the v1 Exchange tables and functions and adds `exchange_positions`, `exchange_events`, the reasons `market_stake` and `market_payout` (v1's `market_fee` is reused; `market_buy` and `market_sell` stay unused, because a reason is never removed) and three server-only functions that move the coins and change the positions in one step.

**Why:** Nils wants real companies and real prices, and investments that can end at zero within a class: at 10x, a real move of 1 % is 10 % of the stake, and a real move of 10 % against a position ends it. Real prices need no amplification rule, so nothing can drift away from reality or sink toward one cent (the v1 problems). A stake can be lost but nothing more, so no balance goes below zero and nobody owes coins. One shared server price, fresh for trades, and no trading on closed or stale companies stop players from trading on prices they know are out of date.

**Trade-offs:**
- Real prices move slowly: in a 90-minute class crypto often moves under 1 %, so a position moves by a few percent to about 10 % of its stake; on a volatile day a position can end at zero.
- The automatic close sees only prices the server fetched; a dip past the zero point between two looks is missed (in the player's favour). No timer is available (Vercel Cron breaks our deploys while we use Services, GitHub Actions is too slow and limited, a database timer would have to fetch prices and hold the key).
- No price protection: a trade can get another price than the screen showed (the board may be 30 s old).
- Prices up to 5 s old leave a fast player who watches the live market a small edge; the 2 % fee each way makes it rarely worth it.
- Real prices are shown as they are, so display rights matter: Binance's terms do not say whether a class game may show its prices; Finnhub's free plan allows it only with written approval; no free source covers European shares.
- At the 11:00 class the US stocks are closed; only the island companies trade.
- Stocks can open far from their last close, which closes rising or falling positions at zero at the open.
- Each server instance holds its own prices in memory, so a fresh instance during an outage shows "no price yet".
- Demo-mode trades change real coins on a public recording (Nils accepted it).

**Alternatives:** amplified prices with a floor, ceiling and pauses (v1); x100 that never reaches zero with daily rounds (item 2a, replaced by 2c); 10x on top of x100 (would end a position after a 0.1 % move); price protection with a tolerance (item 5, not chosen); a timer for the automatic close (not available); per-symbol candles to catch dips (one request per symbol); a shared table of last prices (later).

**History: v1 (superseded).** v1 amplified real moves (game price = base x (1 + multiplier x real change), multiplier 20 to 100), held prices between 25 % and 400 % of a start price, paused a company for 15 minutes after a 30 % move, re-based every day at 08:00 Lisbon, traded whole units with a 10-minute holding time, and limited purchases to 500 coins and 2,000 a day. An independent review found trades on old prices, a predictable public replay and prices sinking toward one cent; the fixes that still apply carry over (prices at most 5 s old for trades, no replay in live mode, the daily cap, 10 trades in 30 s). Its simulations showed that at x100 prices spent most of a multi-day run near their floor. The full v1 text is in git history (`docs/DECISIONS.md` at `3d59b6a`).

**Agreed by, PR and impact:** Nils, 5 Nov 2026. Built on `feat/l4-exchange-v2`. Affects the Exchange panel, card C6 (the Greyfathom share), the Relighting (fees drop, Greyfathom delisted; L3 provides the switch), D014 (Nils owns the Finnhub key) and every package that adds wallet reasons (the list now has 13).
